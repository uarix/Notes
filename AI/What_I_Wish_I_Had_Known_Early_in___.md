## Abstract

**Begin with the end in mind!**  
Ph.D. students in Artificial Intelligence (AI) can start preparing for their career after graduation as soon as they enter graduate school, likely in more ways than they realize. To help with this, Sven Koenig compiled lessons learned from Ph.D. students and researchers, combining them with advice from Nobel Prize and Turing Award winners, as well as his own insights.

## Introduction

This publication is based on a talk given at the International Joint Conference on AI (IJCAI) Doctoral Consortium in 2019. It focuses on how Ph.D. students can prepare for life after graduate school from the very beginning, instead of only when applying for jobs.

General guidelines for success:  
- Prepare early, work hard, and seek advice.  
- Stand out in the crowd through awards, scholarships, or unique research fields.  
- Learn to say “no” when needed.  
- Understand employer expectations and align your preparation accordingly.

## Giving Talks

- Highlight the **“why”** and **“what”** of your research.  
- Use simple language and examples.  
- Include an **executive summary slide** with key takeaways.  
- Rehearse thoroughly and seek feedback.

## Teaching and Mentoring

- Teach one or two classes to improve communication skills.  
- Use teaching as an opportunity to gain depth in your subject area.  

---

## Networking

**Key Tips:**
- Talk to peers, professors, and visitors.  
- Attend conferences and social events.  
- Develop concise "elevator pitches" (2-3 sentences or minutes).  
- Maintain a professional website with your CV, publications, and portfolio.

---

## Managing Your Advisor

- Discuss expectations early and revisit annually.
